It is not easy to determine which is correct by just looking at the printing result from my testdominion,
because my testdominion.c allow the program to execute to the end for 50 times (loop over for 50 times),
when the results of the two programs are different from each other, it would be hard to tell which is
correct. Both of my dominion and my classmate's dominion have high coverage, which both mostly showed over
80% coverage, and the coverage differece is not that much. In overall, both dominion work great under my
tester.
