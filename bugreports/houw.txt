Tested Classmate: houw

A bug I detected in the code is in card “council_room”. The bug was found by my random tester, which there is error occurred when there the player number is bigger than 3 (like playNum = 4), then the fourth player’s “handNum” will be never changed, the error tells the the bug might be at the card number processor of the code.

Actual bug: 
		for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	// where should be i < 4
    			drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
  		}
