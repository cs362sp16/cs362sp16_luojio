A bug I found in the code is in the card “village”. And the bug was found by both of my random and unit tester, where the “numActions” doesn’t seem correct after processing the function, a correct “numActions” output of the function should have original numAction+3, but the result in this code is not correct.

Actual error:
	state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;	// should be state->numActions + 3
